"""Deprecation-warning folding for the flat engine's two merge points.

Two small, pure helpers that fold worker-attached
:class:`~lhp.models.processing.DeprecationWarningRecord`s, deduped by
``(code, file)`` in deterministic first-seen order:

* :func:`merge_flowgroup_warnings` — the PER-PIPELINE fold, run inside the
  engine's ``_finalize`` over one pipeline's sorted
  :class:`~lhp.models.processing.FlowgroupOutcome`s; its result rides on
  :attr:`_PipelinePoolResult.warnings`.
* :func:`merge_pool_warnings` — the WHOLE-BATCH fold, run by the executor over
  every :class:`_PipelinePoolResult`; its result is the single tuple the facade
  re-emits as :class:`~lhp.api.WarningEmitted` events.

Kept out of :mod:`._pool` so that module stays under the §3.3 size cap; this
leaf imports its collaborators only under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` (it merely reads
each carrier's ``.warnings`` attribute at runtime), so it adds NO runtime
import edge back to :mod:`._pool` — no cycle.
