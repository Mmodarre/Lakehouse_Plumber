// ── Action spec vocabulary — the contract for every action sub-type form ─
//
// A `ActionSubTypeSpec` describes, declaratively, how to render an editing
// form for ONE action sub-type (e.g. load/cloudfiles). The shared engine
// (`ActionForm`) is the only renderer; a spec never touches React, yaml-doc,
// or the network. Adding a new sub-type form is: write one spec module +
// one `registry.ts` line — no engine change.
//
// Design rules baked into this vocabulary:
//  • Forms edit EXPLICIT YAML only. Every widget maps a key's presence to a
//    control; clearing a control DELETES the key (never writes '' or null).
//    Keys not named by the spec are never read, written, or reordered.
//  • Every text-ish control tolerates substitution tokens (`${x}`, `{{ x }}`,
//    `%{x}`); the engine handles that uniformly, so specs never special-case
//    tokens.
//  • Client validation is SOFT (hints only) and never blocks a write —
//    `lhp validate` is the authority. `required` + `CrossFieldRule` feed the
//    hint line under a field; that is all they do.
//
// Field addressing: `FieldSpec.path` is relative to the action mapping, e.g.
// `['source', 'format']` or `['write_target', 'cdc_config', 'scd_type']`.
// The engine maps it through flowgroup-doc's `setActionField` /
// `deleteActionField`, which create/prune intermediate containers.

 * the stale-branch bug the Python validator rejects (e.g. a `quarantine:`

 *
 * The shape is uniform across both discriminator styles:
 *  • N-way enum (transform `mode` dqe/quarantine, `write_target.mode`
 *    standard/cdc/snapshot_cdc, `source.type`, `write_target.type`,
 *    `test_type`): one entry per option, each owning that branch's blocks.

 *    its single key; such a toggle may have no backing discriminator key of
 *    its own (see `applyDiscriminatorChange`'s optional `fieldPath`).
 *
 * Paths are relative to the action mapping — the same base `setActionField` /
 * `deleteActionField` expect. A path listed under more than one branch is
